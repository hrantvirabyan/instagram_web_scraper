# instagram_web_scraper
This is a python code that uses selenium.

The program will open chrome, then instagram and follow up with closing all the pop ups from the website.

It will then go to the search bar and look up #dogs.

The program is also meant to download all the images of the dogs it sees however, I am currently looking through the library in order to find out how to download 
the images.
